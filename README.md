# movie_app

This project was made as a faculty project during 2014/2015.

This project was meant to bring in all the movie loves (The seller and The buyer)

The Seller:
can sell put movies for sale with discount or not

The Buyer:
can browse movies in order to buy them, add comments on movies

The Admin:
can monitor the whole process, he can see what movies has discounts, what purchases toke place on the system and the comments on the movies
He can delete offensive comments 

In this project i followed the PHP MVC paradigm. For the database connection i used PDO with mysql

I realised that mysql became deprecated in PHP 5+ and then got removed since PHP 7 i am willing to alter the connections in the future as i am busy meanwhile
